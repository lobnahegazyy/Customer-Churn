Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn, which refers to the likelihood of customers discontinuing a service. Customer churn prediction is critical for businesses to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. In this notebook, various machine learning algorithms are applied to forecast customer churn and derive actionable insights for better retention strategies.

Additionally, the project includes a Streamlit dashboard to visualize predictions and insights interactively.
