# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn by analyzing various customer attributes such as demographics, usage patterns, and payment behavior. Understanding and predicting customer churn helps companies reduce revenue loss by improving customer retention strategies. Machine learning models like LightGBM and Gradient Boosting Classifier have been implemented to provide accurate churn predictions.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
- **Churn Prediction**: Predict customer churn using machine learning algorithms, including Gradient Boosting Classifier, LightGBM, and AdaBoost.
- **Model Evaluation**: Various metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC were used to evaluate model performance. The LightGBM model achieved the highest accuracy of 93.6% and an ROC-AUC score of 0.992.
- **Real-time Prediction**: A **Streamlit** dashboard allows users to input customer data and predict churn in real time.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information with the following key features:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `Tenure`: The duration (in months) the customer has been subscribed to the service.
- `Usage Frequency`: How often the customer uses the service.
- `Support Calls`: Number of calls the customer made to customer support.
- `Payment Delay`: Instances of payment delays by the customer.
- `Subscription Type`: The subscription plan (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium).
- `Contract Length`: The length of the customer's contract (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual).
- `Total Spend`: Total amount spent by the customer.
- `Last Interaction`: The last recorded interaction with the customer.
- `Churn`: Indicates if the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MariamYasser9/Customer_Churn
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook customer_churn_analysis.ipynb
   ```
3.Run the Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Follow the notebook's steps to explore the data, visualize customer segments, and understand churn indicators.

## Machine Learning Models
We have explored several machine learning algorithms, and the performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics:

1. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**:
   - Accuracy: 93.1%
   - ROC-AUC: 0.990

2. **LightGBM**:
   - Accuracy: 93.6%
   - ROC-AUC: 0.992

3. **AdaBoost Classifier**:
   - Accuracy: 93.1%
   - ROC-AUC: 0.989
